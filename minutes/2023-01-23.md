## Notes

* hdf5 pains
    * Figuring out what dtypes are present in an HDF5 dataset
    * 
* C structure (from last meeting) – [link](https://github.com/GraphBLAS/binsparse-reference-impl/blob/main/include/binsparse/c_bindings/binsparse_matrix.h)
* 2.0
    * "Bundled" levels: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/GraphBLAS/binsparse-specification/main?filepath=sparsetensorviz/notebooks/Example_Rank4-bundled.ipynb
    * Discussion: https://github.com/GraphBLAS/binsparse-reference-impl/pull/1
* v1
    * What does the in memory implementation need to do?
    * Could we go for a fairly simple file format, npz
    * If high level, should we define a structure that isn't used?
        * E.g. MLIR, TACO – and are these optimizing for the same thing
        * Willow: they are all using the same buffers
            * Maybe not 1-indexed languages, but basically the same
* TODO
    * Move from design docs to spec
    * Willow can follow up on interoprability with Finch
    * NASA Grant
