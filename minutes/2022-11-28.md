# Binary Sparse Format Working Group Meeting #6 - November 28, 2022

## Attendees
- [X] Ben Brock
- [X] Tim Davis
- [X] Jim Kitchen
- [ ] Tim Mattson
- [ ] Scott McMillan
- [X] Erik Welch
- [X] Isaac Virshup
- [ ] Will Kimmerer

## Agenda

- Discuss specification document infrastructure, layout outline for proceeding with spec doc

- Discuss structure of C/C++ bindings

## Summary of Discussion

- Isaac presented infrastructure for spec draft.
- GitHub bot is set up to render spec, will post comment on PR with link to spec
- Can set up to produce render of `main`, will require some hosting (e.g. GitHub Pages)

- Ben: what should the interface be for C reference API?
- Tim: supporting custom malloc/free is important

Ben will produce draft C bindings that allow providing a custom malloc/free,
providing sparse matrix data using a C struct.  It will be the user's responsibility
to free data using the same allocation method they provided.

- How to store value in iso-valued matrix?
  * We could store directly using JSON
  * However, using JSON has problems, since types may not exactly match those
    in C, or supported by binary storage container.

Set out outline:

1. Introduction / motivation

2. Metadata keys and values
   a. dimensions
   b. format
   c. extra user-defined metadata
   d. types

3. How arrays are stored in memory

4. Description of how arrays are stored in data container (e.g. HDF5)
   - Reader/writer reference implementation?

Specifying HDF5 vs. Zarr vs. both


## Outcomes
- Ben will continue work on C/C++ bindings
- Jim will take a stab at drafting Section 2
- Ben will begin draft of Section 1

- This is a busy period, so progress will likely be a bit slow.
  Next meeting tentatively planned for December 19.
