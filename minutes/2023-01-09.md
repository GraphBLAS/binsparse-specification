## Agenda

- Discuss Tim Davis' matrix C struct

- Discuss Ben's work on HDF5 bindings, as well as issues with HDF5.
  * It is not straightforward to determine the type of an HDF5 dataset.

## Summary of Discussion

Tim discussed the [C matrix](https://github.com/GraphBLAS/binsparse-reference-impl/blob/main/include/binsparse/c_bindings/binsparse_matrix.h) he defined for binsparse.  This consists of the following:
  - Matrix dimensions and number of values
  - Types in the matrix
  - Number of axes
  - Values pointer
  - A pointer to multiple axes
    * Each axis contains a "pointer" or "index"

Ben discussed his implementation of [C bindings](https://github.com/GraphBLAS/binsparse-reference-impl/blob/main/include/binsparse/c_bindings/bc_read_matrix.hpp).

 - One major issue is that HDF5 does not have an easy mechanism in C/C++ to determine the type of a dataset.
   * You are limited to individual queries like type class (e.g. integer, float), endianness, and size.
   * Ben implemented a [helper function](https://github.com/GraphBLAS/binsparse-reference-impl/blob/main/include/binsparse/hdf5_tools.hpp#L77) that does some of this work on top of HDF5.
   * To help with this issue, we should list the types in JSON.
   * Users could specify what types to store the matrix to disk with, even if those don't necessarily match the types stored in memory.  HDF5 should handle this automatically.
