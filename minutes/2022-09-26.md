# Binary Sparse Format Working Group Meeting #3 - September 26, 2022

## Attendees
- [X] Ben Brock
- [ ] Tim Davis
- [X] Jim Kitchen
- [ ] Tim Mattson
- [ ] Scott McMillan
- [X] Erik Welch
- [X] Isaac Virshup
- [ ] Will Kimmerer

## Agenda

- Discuss prototype implementations by Ben, Jim
    * What binary container library should we use?
        Goal: develop plan for evaluating options
        Goal: define what we need to specify vs. container library

- Discuss Erik's progress on V2.0

## Summary of Discussion

- Ben: HDF5 has some pain points
    * Have to pick standard types for disk storage, which can be somewhat arbitrary
    * Currently storing strings as a datset, which is not quite satisfactory
    * Others in issue #9

- Groups can have string attributes
  * Files should have an implicit root group

- Jim: NetCDF sits on top of HDF5 and likely handles some of these issues.

- Jim: should make sure that a library picking different defaults in different
       languages does not prevent some language (e.g. Julia) from inter-operating.

- Erik: V2 update, 

Isaac: How does chunking work?

### Resources and Links
Data type for storing strings in HDF5:
```
DATATYPE  H5T_STRING {
         STRSIZE H5T_VARIABLE;
         STRPAD H5T_STR_NULLTERM;
         CSET H5T_CSET_UTF8;
         CTYPE H5T_C_S1;
      }
```

CDF to HDF5 Converter

TensorStore - Google thing built on top of Zarr/HDF5

conda install -c jim22k sscdf

## Outcomes

- Ben will try using NetCDF in his C++ implementation, looking some of SSCDF's outputs.

- We will meet next week to discuss Erik's updates on V2 in detail.
