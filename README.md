# Binary Sparse Format Specification
This is part of a new effort to create a binary storage format for storing sparse matrices and other sparse data to disk.

Minutes from our meetings are available [here](https://hackmd.io/0qzK4fJlQp-78t067yiYsA?view) [(previous minutes)](minutes).

## Specification

The working version of the specification can be found under `spec/latest/index.bs`.

### Editing

The spec is written in [bikeshed](https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed) â€“ a variant of markdown.
To render the spec locally:

* Install bikeshed (ideally in an isolated environment): `pipx install bikeshed`
* Call `bikeshed spec spec/latest/index.md`

Rendered versions will generated for pull requests.
